# COMP2084 - Server Side Scripting ASP.NET

#TITLE: SNEARKERBOX E-commerce Website

#This assignment is a part of my ASP.NET course at Georgian College. There are 4 components to this assignment. 
The first component is CRUD functionalities.

#SNEAKERBOX is a retail website specifically for sneakers. Users can purchase sneakers of various brands and get information about different sneakers on this site. The site allows the admin to add a new brand or a product and modify/delete the existing details. (A few methods like 'adding the product to cart' or 'viewing the order details' are not fully functional for now.)

#As of now, this site is hosted on my local server. 

#DETAILS:
This web application was built by me on Visual studio using MVC Entity Frameworks and connecting to the database 'SneakerBoxStore' on my local server.
The application includes the following languages: C#, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

The site layout (CSS) is from https://bootswatch.com/lux/
